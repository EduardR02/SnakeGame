# Snake Game  
You can control stuff in the game with all the variables at the top in snake.py  
ms_time is basically gamespeed: the lower the value the faster the game runs  
apple_boost is the amount of length you get per apple
start_size is the stating length
You also could customize the keys for movement in key_control(), otherwise they are "w", "a", "s", "d"
